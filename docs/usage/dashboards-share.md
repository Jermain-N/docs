# Share custom dashboards

OpenCTI provides a simple way to share a visualisation of a custom dashboard to anyone 
even for people that are outside of the platform. We call those visualisations: public dashboards.

Public dashboards are a snapshot of a custom dashboard at a specific moment of time. 
By this way you can share a version of a custom dashboard, then modify you custom dashboard
without worrying about that it will affect the public dashboards you have created.

On the contrary, if you want that your public dashboard is updated with the last version of the
associated custom dashboard, you can do it with few clicks by recreating a public dashboard using
the same of the one to update.
